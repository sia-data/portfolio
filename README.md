# Sia Park
**Marketing Analyst | Data-Driven Growth Strategist | Fast Learner & Relentless Problem Solver**

Hi, I’m **Sia Park** — a marketing professional with 3+ years of hands-on experience driving business growth through digital campaigns, content strategy, and performance marketing. I’m currently transitioning into a marketing analyst role, combining creativity with a growing expertise in **data, programming, and AI**.

Driven by curiosity and a strong belief in lifelong learning, I’ve consistently built my skills through platforms like **Coursera, W3Schools, and DataCamp**, diving into data analysis, Python, and visualization. I’m especially passionate about turning data into actionable insights to solve real business problems.

I’m currently focused on **conversion funnel analysis, A/B testing, and UX research**, and I actively explore projects on **Kaggle** and **GitHub** to sharpen my analytical thinking. 

**My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between data and decision-making with empathy, strategy, and technical skill.✨**
